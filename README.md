So far: lead sounds for specific songs

## Lyjia presets
An archive of synthesizer presets for various virtual instruments. More will be posted when I dig them up. 48 presets for Native Instruments' Massive v1. Made mostly between 2009-2011, presets range between 3-to-5 stars' quality. A variety of pads, leads, and basses, with an emphasis on raw, dirty, distorted dubstep-type material useful with further processing. Future installments will be of higher quality.
